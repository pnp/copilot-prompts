# Create an Agent Instruction / System Prompt Sample

This skill guides creating new agent instruction samples for the pnp/copilot-prompts repository. These samples live inside `samples/agent-instructions/` and represent agents whose system prompt / instructions are the contribution. Contributors build an agent in Microsoft Copilot Studio and share the instructions (system prompt) that power it.

## Before Starting

**Critical**: Always ask the user for the following information before scaffolding:

1. **Agent name** — a short, descriptive name for the agent (e.g., "Communication Assistant", "Smart Crop Doctor", "Elevator Pitch Alchemist")
2. **Agent instructions / system prompt** — the full system prompt text that defines the agent's behavior, personality, skills, and operating principles
3. **Summary** — a short description of what the agent does and why it's useful
4. **Use case category** — one or more categories the agent falls into:
   - 🎮 **Gaming** — AI-powered game ideas, NPC interactions, procedural storytelling
   - 📚 **Storytelling & Creative Writing** — Fiction, poetry, and immersive storytelling prompts
   - 🤖 **AI Assistants** — Virtual assistants, chatbots, and productivity helpers
   - 🛠️ **Productivity & Tools** — Code generation, automation, and workflow improvements
   - 🎓 **Education** — Learning aids, tutoring, and interactive teaching tools
   - 🏥 **Healthcare & Wellbeing** — AI for mental health, fitness, and well-being support
   - 🌎 **Other** — If the idea doesn't fit the above
5. **Author name** — the contributor's full name
6. **Author GitHub username** — the contributor's GitHub handle

If the user doesn't provide all details upfront, ask for the missing ones before proceeding.

## Sample Directory Structure

Create the sample in `samples/agent-instructions/{agent-name}/`:

```
samples/agent-instructions/{agent-name}/
├── assets/
│   └── sample.json          # Metadata for the M365 Solution Gallery
├── readme.md                # Documentation with agent instructions
```

**Folder naming rules:**
- Use lowercase and hyphens only (e.g., `daily-chore-children`, `communication-assistant`, `peace-keeper-agent`)
- Do NOT use periods/dots in the folder name
- Keep it concise but descriptive — it should hint at what the agent does
- Do NOT include prefixes like `m365-` or `github-` — agent instruction folders use plain descriptive names

## Step 1: Create readme.md

Create `samples/agent-instructions/{agent-name}/readme.md` using this structure:

```markdown
# 🎯 {Agent Name}

## Summary

{Short summary of what this agent does, its purpose, and why it's useful.}

## Instruction

```
{The full agent instructions / system prompt goes here.

This is the core contribution — the complete system prompt that defines:
- The agent's identity and purpose
- Execution steps or workflow
- Operating principles and guidelines
- Tone and personality
- Example interactions (optional)
- Limitations and constraints (optional)}
```

![](https://m365-visitor-stats.azurewebsites.net/SamplesGallery/copilotprompts-{agent-name})
```

**README rules:**
- The file should be named `readme.md` (matching existing convention in agent-instructions)
- The **Instruction** section is the most important part — it contains the full system prompt in a fenced code block
- The system prompt should be well-structured with clear sections (Purpose, Execution Steps, Operating Principles, Tone, etc.)
- The **Instructions 📝** section (how to use) always describes the Copilot Studio agent builder workflow
- The tracking image at the bottom MUST follow the pattern: `https://m365-visitor-stats.azurewebsites.net/SamplesGallery/copilotprompts-{agent-name}`
- Include the Help and Disclaimer sections exactly as shown
- Use the current date for the version history in `{Month DD, YYYY}` format
- Mark the correct Use Case Category checkboxes based on what the user selected

## Step 2: Create Metadata (assets/sample.json)

Create `samples/agent-instructions/{agent-name}/assets/sample.json`:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "copilotprompts-{agent-name}",
    "source": "pnp",
    "title": "{Agent Title}",
    "shortDescription": "{Short description of what the agent does}",
    "url": "https://github.com/pnp/copilot-prompts/tree/main/samples/agent-instructions/{agent-name}",
    "downloadUrl": "https://pnp.github.io/download-partial/?url=https://github.com/pnp/copilot-prompts/tree/main/samples/agent-instructions/{agent-name}",
    "longDescription": [
      "{A longer description of what the agent does and why it's useful.}"
    ],
    "creationDateTime": "{YYYY-MM-DD}",
    "updateDateTime": "{YYYY-MM-DD}",
    "products": [
      "Copilot"
    ],
    "metadata": [],
    "thumbnails": [
      {
        "type": "image",
        "order": 100,
        "url": "",
        "alt": ""
      }
    ],
    "authors": [
      {
        "gitHubAccount": "{github-username}",
        "pictureUrl": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/{github-username}",
        "name": "{Author Name}"
      }
    ],
    "references": [
      {
        "name": "Microsoft Copilot",
        "description": "Microsoft Copilot",
        "url": "https://copilot.microsoft.com/"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

**Key metadata rules:**
- `name`: Always `copilotprompts-{agent-name}` where `{agent-name}` is the folder name
- `shortDescription` and `longDescription[0]`: Should describe the agent's purpose; `longDescription` can be more detailed
- `creationDateTime` and `updateDateTime`: Use `YYYY-MM-DD` format with the current date
- `products`: Always `["Copilot"]` for agent instruction samples
- `source`: Always `"pnp"`
- `url`: Points to `samples/agent-instructions/{agent-name}` on GitHub main branch
- `downloadUrl`: Uses the pnp partial download service URL pointing to the same path
- `pictureUrl` for authors: Use `https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/{username}`
- `thumbnails`: Leave `url` and `alt` empty if no screenshot is available yet — the contributor can add one later

## Step 3: Remind About Screenshots

After creating the files, remind the user to:
1. Optionally add a screenshot of the agent in action to the `assets/` folder
2. If they add a screenshot, update the `thumbnails` section in `sample.json` with the URL and alt text
3. They can also add a screenshot reference in the readme after the Summary section

## Writing Good Agent Instructions

When helping a user craft their system prompt, encourage them to include these sections:

1. **Purpose / Identity** — Who is the agent? What is its core mission?
2. **Execution Steps** — Step-by-step workflow the agent follows
3. **Operating Principles / Guidelines** — Rules and constraints for the agent's behavior
4. **Tone** — How the agent should communicate (warm, professional, playful, etc.)
5. **Example Interactions** (optional) — Sample conversations showing expected input/output
6. **Limitations** (optional) — What the agent cannot or should not do
7. **Privacy and Safety** (optional) — Any data handling or safety considerations

The system prompt should be detailed enough that anyone can paste it into Copilot Studio's Instructions field and get a working agent.

## Validation Checklist

Before finalizing, verify:
- [ ] Folder is inside `samples/agent-instructions/` (NOT directly under `samples/`)
- [ ] Folder name is lowercase with hyphens only, no dots, no app-host prefix
- [ ] `readme.md` exists
- [ ] `readme.md` contains the full system prompt in a fenced code block under the **Instruction** section
- [ ] At least one Use Case Category is checked
- [ ] `assets/` folder exists
- [ ] `assets/sample.json` exists with valid JSON
- [ ] `sample.json` `name` field matches pattern `copilotprompts-{agent-name}`
- [ ] `sample.json` `products` is `["Copilot"]`
- [ ] `sample.json` URLs include the full path `samples/agent-instructions/{agent-name}`
- [ ] `sample.json` dates are in `YYYY-MM-DD` format
- [ ] README tracking image URL matches `copilotprompts-{agent-name}`
- [ ] README contains Instructions, Help, and Disclaimer sections
- [ ] Author information is filled in

## Key Rules

- **This skill is for agent instruction / system prompt samples ONLY** — not for simple prompt samples
- Samples MUST go in `samples/agent-instructions/{agent-name}/`, never directly under `samples/`
- Every sample needs exactly: `readme.md` + `assets/sample.json`
- The core contribution is the **system prompt / agent instructions** in the readme's Instruction section
- The `products` field in sample.json is always `["Copilot"]` (these are Copilot Studio agents)
- Prerequisites are always "Copilot License"
- The Instructions section always describes the Copilot Studio agent builder workflow
- The `sample.json` feeds the [M365 Solution Gallery](https://adoption.microsoft.com/en-us/sample-solution-gallery/) — accuracy matters
- Follow existing naming patterns in the `agent-instructions` folder for consistency
