## Summary
This prompt helps users recover control of their workload by checking Outlook, Teams, To Do, Planner and Calendar data to identify overdue, forgotten, or unacknowledged tasks. It highlights actionable items, prioritizes them by urgency and suggest next steps.

## Prompt💡

Act as my task recovery assistant.

Search across my Microsoft 365 data, including Outlook, Teams, To Do, and Planner and identify any tasks that appear overdue, forgotten, or unacknowledged.

Specifically:
- List tasks that were assigned to me but I haven’t responded to or completed.
- Find action items from emails or Teams chats I didn’t follow up on.
- Highlight calendar events with prep work or follow-ups I’ve likely missed.
- Include To Do or Planner tasks that are past due or have no status update.
- Flag anything urgent or that someone may be waiting on from me.

Then:
- Categorize these tasks by urgency (High, Medium, Low).
- Suggest which ones to tackle today based on my calendar availability.
- Optionally: Draft quick responses I can send to acknowledge or delegate them.

### Description ℹ️
Quickly surface overdue, forgotten or unacknowledged tasks across Outlook, Teams, To Do and Planner, then prioritize and suggest next steps.
