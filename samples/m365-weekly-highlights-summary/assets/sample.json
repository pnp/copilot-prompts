    "longDescription": [
      "This prompt acts as a Weekly Highlights Assistant by searching across Microsoft 365 data sources such as Outlook, Teams, To Do, and Planner, for the past week. It compiles a professional summary with three structured sections: Key Wins (top 3 accomplishments), Plans for Next Week (upcoming priorities), and Risks and Blockers (presented in a clear table format). The tone is confident and manager-friendly, making it ideal for weekly reporting, stakeholder updates, or performance tracking. The output is formatted for easy copy and paste into emails."
