# 🚀 7-Day Sent Items and Remind Action 💻

Bored of tracking requests, questions, or tasks you sent by email and not sure whether anyone answered?

![Sample](https://github.com/ondrejvysek/copilot-prompts/blob/m365-7-day-sent-review-and-remind-action/samples/m365-7-day-sent-review-and-remind-action/sample/sample1.png)

## Summary

This prompt is built for anyone who wants a fast, reliable way to review what they sent in the last 7 days and see what still needs a follow-up, and remind the recipient.

It scans **Sent Items only**, deduplicates **conversation threads**, checks whether there is a **reply after your latest sent message**, and produces a structured action list.

The output is split into:

- Immediate Action (threads where you @mentioned someone and asked for action)
- Action Required
- Other (everything else that was reviewed but did not require action)

Each section is divided into:
  - External (likely customers or partners)
  - Internal (people inside your org)

**Important:** This prompt is designed for **Microsoft 365 Copilot with GPT-5** to handle threading, reply detection, exclusions, and structured formatting.

## Prompt 💡

```
Task: Review my Sent Items for the past 7 days and prepare a prioritized action list in English showing whether I have received any responses to those sent messages.

Scope rules (apply exactly):
- Folder: Sent Items only (exclude subfolders, Archive, Junk/Spam, Deleted Items).
- Time window: past 7 days from now; show all times in my local timezone.
- People scope: include messages I personally sent (From = me).
- Threading: deduplicate conversation threads; list each thread once using the latest sent message within the last 7 days; include a thread only if that latest sent in my Sent Items is within the last 7 days.

Response detection logic (for each sent thread):
- Determine whether any inbound reply to my latest sent exists after that sent, anywhere in my Inbox.
- If there is an inbound reply after my latest sent → mark as “Responded” and include only if the inbound reply requests further action.
- If there is no inbound reply after my latest sent → mark as “No response yet” and include.

Action relevance filter:
- Include only emails where I requested input, decision, or deliverable from the recipient (e.g., proposal, data, approval, feedback that enables next steps).
- If the inbound reply is an automated response (e.g., out-of-office), ignore it for response status.
- Exclude emails where I only asked for confirmation (e.g., “Is this okay?”, “Do I need to do anything else?”). These go to Other.
- Exclude emails where my intent was purely to provide information or deliverables without expecting any reply or further action from the recipient.
- If the email contains both informational and action-request content, treat it as action-request if any actionable item exists.

Exclusions (must drop these even if no response):
- Notification-only and automated content (noreply/no-reply/do-not-reply/no_reply senders; Teams notification emails like noreply@*.teams.microsoft.com; system alerts; digests; newsletters; bulk marketing).
- Training or informational broadcasts with no action, e.g., subjects containing: “E-Learning”, “Training reminder”, “Newsletter”, “Digest”, “Notification”, “Alert”, “System message”, “FYI only”, “Do not reply”.
- Calendar invite auto-notifications unless the body explicitly asks me to take a non-calendar action.

Prioritization and sort:
- Priority bands in this order:
  1) Sent emails where I explicitly @mentioned someone (and requested action).
  2) Sent emails requesting action but with no inbound response yet.
- Within each band, sort newest to oldest by my latest sent date.
- Within each band, if two items have the same sent date, sort alphabetically by subject.

Internal vs external classification (for Action Required only):
- Classify each thread as Internal or External based on recipient email domains.
- If ANY recipient has a domain outside my organization’s domain(s), classify as External.
- Otherwise classify as Internal.
- If the organization domain list is not available from context/tooling, infer it from my email address domain and treat that as internal; all other domains are external.

Output format:
- Make each action title bold.
- Include a short snippet (first 10 words) from my sent email body for context under each item.
- For every item, include: Subject, Recipient(s) (summarized), my latest Sent date (local time), Response status (“No response yet” or “Responded – further action”), and a one-line Next step you recommend (include what I asked for).
- Split each section into TWO subheadings in this exact order:
  - "### 🌐 External"
  - "### 🏢 Internal"
- Under each subheading, provide a single numbered list for the emails that meet the criteria (i.e., not in Immediate Action), keeping the numbering continuous across External + Internal (do not restart numbering).
- If nothing matches under a subheading, state that explicitly under that subheading.

- Start with the exact heading: "## Immediate Action".
  - Prefix any item where I’ve @mentioned someone in the sent email with “‼️ ”.
- Continue with the heading "## Action Required".
- Last, add the section "## Other" listing all other sent threads examined (Recipient(s) – Subject – Sent date) that did not require action, to confirm nothing was missed.

Edge-case handling:
- If multiple sent messages exist in the same thread within the 7-day window, only consider the latest sent for response detection and action relevance.
```

Description ℹ️
This prompt delivers a practical follow up radar for your outbound email.

It scans **Sent Items** for the last 7 days, deduplicates conversation threads, checks whether you received a reply after your latest sent message, and outputs a prioritized action list.

The results are split into:

- Immediate Action  
  Threads where you @mentioned someone and requested an action
- Action Required  
  Split into External and Internal recipients to separate customer follow ups from inside work
- Other  
  Everything reviewed but filtered out because it did not require action or was excluded by rules

This is designed for people who send a lot of action asking emails  
Sales, presales, delivery leads, team leads, and execs.
