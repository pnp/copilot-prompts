    "longDescription": [
      "This prompt reviews your Outlook Inbox for the last 7 days and creates a structured, prioritized action list. It applies strict scope rules: only messages where you are in 'To', excludes automated notifications and newsletters, deduplicates threads, and categorizes emails into Immediate Action (@mentions), Action Required (Unread or Read-but-not-replied), and Other (informational). Each item includes subject, sender, local timestamp, and a recommended next step for efficient inbox triage.",
      "Requires GPT-5 capabilities in Microsoft 365 Copilot to handle complex filtering, threading logic, and structured output formatting."
