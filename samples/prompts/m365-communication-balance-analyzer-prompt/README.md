# Communication Balance Analyzer

![Screenshot of the prompt in use](./assets/demo.png)

## Summary

This prompt analyzes your recent work context to identify one area where you may be over‑communicating and one where you may be under‑communicating, helping you fine‑tune how you share information with your team.

## Prompt 💡

Look at my recent work context and tell me one thing I'm over‑communicating and one thing I'm under‑communicating. Be specific and constructive.

## Description ℹ️

Effective communication at work isn't just about saying more or less — it's about saying the right things to the right people. This prompt leverages Microsoft 365 Copilot's awareness of your recent emails, chats, meetings, and documents to surface patterns you might not notice yourself. It returns one concrete area where you may be providing too much detail or repeating yourself, and one area where stakeholders might benefit from hearing more from you. The feedback is specific and constructive so you can take immediate action.
