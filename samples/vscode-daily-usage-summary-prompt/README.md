# 📊 VS Code Daily Usage Summary 💻

## Summary
This prompt generates a comprehensive daily usage summary of your VS Code activity. It analyzes metrics such as lines of code written, new files added, files changed, and total time spent in VS Code. This helps developers track their productivity, assist PR reviewers with context, and provide insights for individual developer summaries.

## Prompt💡

Analyze my VS Code activity for today and provide a summary including:
- Total lines of code written
- Number of new files created
- Number of files modified

Format this as a professional summary suitable for PR reviewers and performance evaluations.
